# EndeavourOS Quickstart Installer Rewrite
My rewrite of the Endeavour OS Quickstart Installer app in Python.
Similar to the original, it uses Qt, but this time integrates with the system better in my opinion.

Alongside installation of new software, it can now uninstall existing software as well. I've also added support for a few extra terminal applications, and added Haruna in the Video Players section.

I've found the code of the original a bit difficult to work with -but that's probably me being a novice in C++- therefore I've decided to rewrite the application in Python, mostly as an exercise, but I think the UI in my version looks better.
